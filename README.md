# Blaise_Stats
My own sabermetrics website

To view my web app go [here](https://infinite-refuge-56638.herokuapp.com/)

If you prefer to run this application locally run the following commands:
'''
git clone https://github.com/BlaisePage/Blaise_Stats
cd Blaise_Stats/src/
export FLASK_APP=app.py
flask run
'''

Note, that this code has a few package dependencies. In order to install the correct packages run:
'''
pip3 install flask
pip3 install pandas
pip3 install bokeh
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install os
'''

Once the app is running navigate to the corresponding localhost port to view the app.
